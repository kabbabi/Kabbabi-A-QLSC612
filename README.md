# Assignment for the course QLSC-612 (BHS2020 - Week 1/4)

## Description

This repository contains the assignment for the course QLSC-612 in the context of the Brain Hack School 2020 session.
I created a notebook  "practical/myanalysis.ipynb" which illustrates the phenomenon of p-hacking by using the dataset "brainsize.csv" in the folder "practical".

The necessary tools and libraries to install are described in "requirements.txt"
The analysis can be run on a Jupyter Notebook environment once the right installations are done.

## Outputs

The notebook "practical/myanalysis.ipynb" generates :
1. An overview of the content of "brainsize.csv" (head() method)
2. A summary of the model used in the analysis
3. A scatterplot (Fig.1)
4. Two outputs of Pearson's R and p-value
5. A pair of histograms (Fig.2 - (a) and (b))

The notebook is subdivided into multiple cells commented all along with markdowns and python comments to describe the method used for p-hacking.
